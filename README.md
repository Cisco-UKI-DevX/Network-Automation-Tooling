# Network Automation and Tooling Workshop

The idea behind this material is to allow Cisco SE's, partners and Cisco customers to get to grips with some of the key concepts of network automation, starting off with the underlying tooling thats most commonly used.

As of today we currently have the following modules built (please note, we're aiming for each workshop to have a crawl / walk / run levels of complexity, please note this is being built as we go so at the minute some of the modules may be at different levels of completeness.)
