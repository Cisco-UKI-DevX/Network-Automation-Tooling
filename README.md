# Network Automation and Tooling Workshop

Welcome to our Network Automation and tooling labs, these labs have been built to be used during a presenter delivered workshop however can act as standalone guides to get you familiar with some of the technologies covered. These labs are designed to be hands on to give the student experience in using the tools discussed. The normal suggested agenda for the workshop can be seen below with the suggested lab guides:

- Source Control – [Git/Gitlab/Github](https://github.com/GShuttleworth/Introduction-to-Source-Control)
- Configuration management - [Ansible](https://github.com/sttrayno/Ansible-Lab-Guide)
- Configuration management - [Terraform](https://github.com/sttrayno/Terraform-Lab-Guide)
- Network testing and validation – [pyATS](https://github.com/sttrayno/pyATS-Lab-Guide)
- Rest API’s and Scripting – [Python/REST](https://github.com/GShuttleworth/REST-API-Lab-Guide)

`N.B. If you would like the slides to deliver this session as a workshop please drop me an email on sttrayno@cisco.com I'd be happy to provide them`

This content is being built out as we go for workshops and demos so is currently subject to change. The goal of this material is to allow Cisco SE's, partners and Cisco customers to get to grips with some of the key concepts of network automation, starting off with the underlying tooling thats most commonly used and provide a way for people to leverage some of the custom content thats already out there but has been a bit fragmented

I'm making this completely available to the community, please feel free to branch this out and build you own content, use it as you wish and please raise an issue on the repo if you spot any issues. Also feel free to reach out to me on twitter @sttrayno or through email at sttrayno@cisco.com if you have feedback or suggestions on the content.

*Special thank you to Julio Gomez, Simon Hart and Hank Preston whos content has been used quite extensively for some of these initial labs*

*Extra special thanks to Greg Shuttleworth for building and reviewing the guides*
