Welcome to our Network Automation and tooling labs, these labs have been built to be used during a presenter delivered workshop however can act as standalone guides to get you familiar with some of the technologies covered. The normal suggested agenda for the workshop can be seen below with the suggested lab guides:

- Source Control – Gitlab/Github
- Configuration management - Ansible - https://github.com/sttrayno/Ansible-Lab-Guide
- Standardised interfaces to devices – NETCONF / RESTCONF
- Network testing and validation – pyATS - https://github.com/sttrayno/pyATS-Lab-Guide
- Rest API’s and Scripting – Python/REST

`N.B. If you would like the slides to deliver this session as a workshop please drop me an email on sttrayno@cisco.com I'd be happy to provide them`

This content is being built out as we go for workshops and demos so is currently subject to change. The goal of this material is to allow Cisco SE's, partners and Cisco customers to get to grips with some of the key concepts of network automation, starting off with the underlying tooling thats most commonly used and provide a way for people to leverage some of the custom content thats out there.

As of today we currently have the following modules built (please note, we're aiming for each workshop to have a crawl / walk / run levels of complexity, please note this is being built as we go so at the minute some of the modules may be at different levels of completeness.)
