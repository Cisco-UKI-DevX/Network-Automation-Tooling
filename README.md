# Network Automation and Tooling Workshop

Welcome to our Network Automation and tooling labs, these labs have been built to be used during a presenter delivered workshop however can act as standalone guides to get you familiar with some of the technologies this lab covers. My suggested agenda for the workshop is:

- Source Control – Gitlab/Github
- Configuration management - Ansible - https://github.com/sttrayno/Ansible-Lab-Guide
- Standardised interfaces to devices – NETCONF / RESTCONF
- Network testing and validation – pyATS - https://github.com/sttrayno/pyATS-Lab-Guide
- Rest API’s and Scripting – Python/REST
- Streaming telemetry – gRPC/InfinitiDB/Grafana - https://github.com/sttrayno/Streaming-Telemetry-Lab-Guide

I am building out this content as I go for workshops and demos so it may sometimes be in state of flux and always being added to, but the idea behind this material is to allow Cisco SE's, partners and Cisco customers to get to grips with some of the key concepts of network automation, starting off with the underlying tooling thats most commonly used.

As of today we currently have the following modules built (please note, we're aiming for each workshop to have a crawl / walk / run levels of complexity, please note this is being built as we go so at the minute some of the modules may be at different levels of completeness.)

I'm making this completely available to the community, please feel free to branch this out and build you own content, use it as you wish and please if you spot any errors raise an issue on the repo. Also feel free to reach out to me on twitter @sttrayno or through email at sttrayno@cisco.com
